							In November 2022, NASA officially launched the Artemis program, which began with an unmanned flight of the Orion spacecraft around the moon. He successfully went into space using the Space Launch System (SLS) launch vehicle and set off on his journey. In an article about this event, we noted that Orion should return to Earth on December 11 - expectations were justified. On Sunday, the spacecraft splashed down safely in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Helicopters immediately surrounded him, and a warship arrived at the scene to transport cargo to land. However, the space "Orion" was in no hurry to pull out of the water - there were good reasons for this. A couple of interesting facts can be told about the completion of the Artemis-1 mission, which we will now do.
